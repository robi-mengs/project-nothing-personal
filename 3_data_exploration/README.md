# Data Exploration

This project does not include a traditional exploratory data analysis (EDA)
phase because:

- No real-world dataset is used.
- All data is **synthetically generated** within the analysis notebook
  ([privacy_protection.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-ssAXLpjf9C04apXQY-AMap8Ym3hp9oT#scrollTo=MDphAmN8cQ5Q))
  to illustrate privacy risks and mitigation strategies.
- The focus is on **strategic simulation and inference**, not understanding the
  properties of an observed dataset.

If real patent or search log data is incorporated in the future, EDA notebooks
will be added here to:

- Visualize filing trends
- Analyze search term distributions
- Profile technology category frequencies
- Check data quality and structure

# Domain Research

## Domain Study README

## Overview

This folder contains research materials to explore the problem domain, identify
key challenges, and guide the project's direction. It serves as a knowledge base
to understand the context, problem statement and background review.

## The Research Question

How can privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy create a
fairer innovation ecosystem by providing underrepresented inventors with market
intelligence and idea protection without compromising their intellectual
property?

### Defining the Scope

For this research, **"underrepresented inventors"** refers to individuals and
groups who face systematic barriers in accessing and benefiting from traditional
innovation ecosystems. This includes inventors from marginalized early-stage
startup founders lacking access to legal or capital resources.

Many such individuals also identify as **entrepreneurs** building ventures from
their inventions. Both terms appear in the analysis, but **"underrepresented
inventors"** serves as the core focus when examining the specific
vulnerabilities of the pre-commercialization, ideation, and early-protection
phases where privacy-preserving technologies can create the most equitable
impact.

## Purpose

The domain study aims to:

- Establish a thorough understanding of the problem domain
- Identify existing solutions and their limitations
- Complete research process documentation
- Uncover research gaps and opportunities
- Provide insights to guide project direction
- Create a knowledge base for team members and stakeholders

## Folder Structure

### 📁 Research Notes

**Location:** `./research_notes/`

Central hub for the research process documentation and findings.

### 📄 Problem Statement

**Location:** `./problem_statement.md`

Definitive problem framing for the project, including the final research
question and its rationale.

- Underrepresented inventors face a dangerous choice: keep ideas secret and
  stifle development, or share them and risk theft, with neither option being
  safe.

- The innovation ecosystem lacks accessible tools to protect ideas and provide
  market intelligence during the vulnerable, early pre-patent phase.

- This systemic gap disproportionately harms inventors from marginalized
  backgrounds, blocking diverse talent and ideas from ever reaching the market.


### 📄 Background Review

**Location:** `./background_review.md`

Comprehensive background analysis of the innovation equity and privacy
technology domain.

- **Domain Overview:** Examination of how Privacy-Preserving Technologies (PPTs)
  like differential privacy can create fairer innovation ecosystems, with core
  themes including underrepresented inventors, intellectual property protection,
  and market intelligence access.
- **Technological Foundations:** Detailed exploration of PPTs including
  Differential Privacy (DP) as a formal mathematical framework, along with
  Federated Learning, Homomorphic Encryption, Secure Multi-Party Computation,
  and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
- **Conceptual Framework:** Definition of "fair innovation ecosystems" with
  focus on "fair access to insights," characterization of underrepresented
  inventors, and analysis of intellectual property and market intelligence
  needs.
- **Systemic Barriers:** Analysis of information asymmetry ("Ideation Black
  Box"), resource constraints, financial vulnerability, network exclusion,
  implicit bias, and risk aversion affecting underrepresented innovators.
- **Opportunities and Innovations:** Identification of how PPTs can level the
  playing field, unlock hidden ideas, create new data products, and introduce
  novel applications like "risk-free query" models and trusted intermediary
  platforms.
- **Research Justification:** Identification of missing interdisciplinary
  synthesis between computer science and innovation studies, timing based on
  technological maturity of DP, and theoretical, practical, and critical
  research value.
- **Case Studies:** Real-world examples including USPTO vulnerability periods,
  US Census Bureau DP implementation, and commercial privacy-preserving
  analytics platforms (IEX Cloud & Oasis Labs).
- **Conceptual Anchors:** Four key frameworks connecting technical mechanisms
  (Differential Privacy), ethical goals (fairness), problem domains (idea
  theft), and measurable metrics (insight access gap).

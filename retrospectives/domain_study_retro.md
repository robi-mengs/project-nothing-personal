# Retrospective: Preparing the Domain Study

When I began this project, I didn’t have a clear technical question. I only knew
I wanted to explore the intersection of **privacy technologies** and my own
**entrepreneurial experience** combined with Data Science. My original
assumption wasn’t rooted in data or theory, but in curiosity: *“How can privacy
tools serve innovators like me?”* I deliberately chose to step outside my
comfort zone by pursuing an **evaluative data science approach** instead of a
traditional qualitative or quantitative study—something I’d never done before.

The hardest part of shaping the domain study was **scope**. The space of
“privacy in innovation” is vast, abstract, and interdisciplinary. I kept asking:
*Where do I draw the line?* Should I focus on legal frameworks? Surveillance
capitalism? Data ethics in AI? It took multiple iterations to narrow my lens to
a **concrete, testable problem**, that early-stage patent searches might leak
strategic intent and that this risk falls heaviest on underrepresented inventors
with no legal safety net.

I hit a real dead end when I realized I **couldn’t ethically or legally test
real USPTO search behavior**. I wanted to know: *Do queries leave footprints?
Can competitors infer your idea?* But probing live government systems wasn’t an
option. Instead of abandoning the question, I pivoted. I had an idea to
**generate synthetic patent data** that mirrored USPTO structure and behavior,
allowing me to simulate the threat and test defenses—**safely, legally, and
reproducibly**. This became the foundation of my entire analysis.

What surprised me most was that I did it **entirely alone** under the guidance
of an experienced friend of mine Ian whom I met from the MIT Emerging
Talent.Narrowing a vague intuition into a sharp research question, *“How can
differential privacy create a fairer innovation ecosystem?”*—was one of the
hardest intellectual challenges I’ve taken on. But it was also deeply
empowering. I pushed myself to the edge, and in doing so, I proofed something
that’s not just academically sound, but personally meaningful.

This domain study isn’t perfect, but it’s **mine**. And it reflects a journey
from uncertainty to purpose, one synthetic patent at a time.

# Communication Strategy

## Who I’m Talking To — For Now

As a junior data scientist, I’m beginning with **one core group**:  
**Fellow early-career innovators and indie founders** especially those working
alone or in small teams without legal or corporate backing.

Think:

- Solo inventors building hardware or software in garages, labs, or community
- workshops
- Student researchers prototyping IP-heavy projects  
- Freelancers and micro-startup founders exploring patent landscapes for the
  first time  

These are people like me: curious, resourceful, but **not protected by legal
teams**, so every patent search feels a little risky.

## What I’m Saying — Simply & Honestly

**Core message**:  
> “You shouldn’t have to risk your idea just to research it.”

I’m sharing:

1. **A real problem** : how your patent searches quietly reveal your secret  
   project
2. **A small but working fix** : a privacy-preserving search method (using
   differential privacy)  
3. **Proof it works** : side-by-side visuals showing “exposed” vs. “protected”  
   research
4. **Code you can run yourself** : no black boxes, just open, reproducible  
   Python

No jargon. No overpromising. Just: *“Here’s something I built because I worried
about this too.”*

## Why Start Small?

Because:

- Big institutions won’t listen until you **show traction** with real users  
- Complex policy arguments come *after* you prove value to individuals  
- As a junior voice, **authenticity > authority**  

My goal isn’t to change the USPTO tomorrow. It’s to help **10 inventors feel
safer** this month and then 100 next quarter.

## My First Artifact

A single, well-documented Jupyter notebook:  
[`privacy_protection.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13X7I2eD6g1cUVMU603GrBmRNMIrMtenu?authuser=0#scrollTo=mntgRugXnkxY)

It’s designed to be:

- **Self-contained** (uses synthetic data—no legal risk)  
- **Visual** (you *see* the risk and the fix)  
- **Runnable** (just `pip install diffprivlib` and go)  
- **Shareable** (easy to send to a founder friend with: *“Try this before your
  next patent search”*)

From this one notebook, everything else can grow:

- A blog post explaining the idea in plain English  
- A Twitter/X thread with the key visual  
- A short demo video for maker communities  

No big campaigns. No press releases. Just **real help, real talk, real people**.

This isn’t about going viral.  
It’s about **starting where I am**, with what I can do and letting trust (and
code) do the rest.
